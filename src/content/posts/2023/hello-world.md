Another developer with a blog. Yay. It's a bit clich√©, I know, but I'm excited to start this new journey, and I hope that this will be the first of many posts that I'll be writing.

```ts
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

## Me

I'm Nate, an aspiring game developer who loves exploring new technologies and skills. Currently, I'm focusing on web development with TypeScript, exploring different web frameworks through various projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, creating pixel art, and watching TV shows.

## Why I'm starting a blog

I'm not usually the type to spill the beans about my thoughts on personal or political stuff, but I do enjoy talking about technology. Adding a blog to my site gives me a platform to share my thoughts and experiences with others, even if this ends up with no one reading them. I also hope that this will help me improve my writing skills.

## My goals in the industry

One of my goals as a developer is to contribute to the open-source community. I hope to participate in other projects and create my own open-source software that people will find useful. It's a rewarding feeling to be able to give back to the community that has taught me so much.

I'm also interested in game development. I've played around with the Godot Engine in the past, and I hope to revisit this in the future to create my own games.

## What I'll be writing about

For this blog, you can expect a lot of tech talk. Since I'm still in the early stages of my journey, I'll be writing mostly about my learning experiences and progress with my projects. In the future, I also hope to write tutorials on topics I'm confident in.
