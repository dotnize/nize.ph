October is coming, and with it [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/), a yearly celebration of open source. As a developer who has learned and grown a lot thanks to open-source communities, I want to share why I think it matters and why we should care more about it.

## The backbone of tech

While technologies like blockchain and AI are making headlines today, open source has quietly powered much of our digital world for decades, forming the foundation of almost everything we use in tech today. Yet, despite being so essential, it often feels underappreciated and underfunded.

People often think open source is just "free software" you download. But there's so much more happening beneath the surface — a whole ecosystem of collaboration, shared knowledge, and collective problem-solving that powers the technology we use every day.

## A non-zero-sum game

One of my favorite articulations comes from Anthony Fu. In his [post on sponsorship forwarding,](https://antfu.me/posts/sponsorship-forwarding#why-am-i-doing-this) he writes:

> Does everyone do open source completely selflessly? I doubt that. But does that mean everyone is doing it solely for their own benefit? I don’t believe that either. The beauty of open source lies in its non-zero-sum nature, where maintainers can derive benefits such as a sense of accomplishment, skill improvement, recognition, and reputation, while providing value to benefit the entire world.

That’s the part I love most. Open source is not charity, but a non-zero-sum game where everyone can win. Unlike physical resources, code and knowledge can be shared infinitely without loss. When someone improves an open-source tool, everyone benefits from that improvement.

## Why should we care?

If you’re reading this, chances are you’re already using open source every single day — in your tools, your apps, even the operating systems powering your devices. Beyond the practical benefits, open source embodies deeper values that matter to all of us:

- **Openness and Transparency**

  Anyone can see the code. That means no hidden tricks, no black boxes. This openness helps us trust the software we rely on.

- **Shared Security**

  Thousands of eyes looking at the same code means bugs and vulnerabilities are spotted and fixed faster. Together, we build stronger, safer systems.

- **Collaboration and Community**

  Open source is about more than just code. It’s about sharing, collaboration, and giving back. It feels less like consuming and more like contributing to something bigger.

- **Faster Innovation**

  Instead of reinventing the wheel, developers can build on each other’s work. This leads to faster innovation and better tools for everyone.

- **Open Doors for Everyone**

  Because open source is often free to use, it lowers the barrier to entry. Whether you’re a student, a startup, or from a community with fewer resources, you can still access powerful technology.

## How can we help?

If want to learn more about open source and how you can contribute beyond code, check out initiatives like [OSI](https://opensource.org/) and [oss/acc](https://ossacc.com/). Support your favorite maintainers on platforms like [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) or [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/). Contribute to documentation, report bugs, or help with translations. Even spreading the word helps!

If you're from the Philippines like me, consider supporting local efforts like [BetterGov.ph](https://bettergov.ph/), [OpenBayan](https://www.openbayan.org/), [OSS PH](https://ossph.org/), and [Hacktoberfest Cebu](https://hf.cebutechcommunities.org/).

This October, whether you join Hacktoberfest or not, I hope you take a moment to think about the open-source projects and tools you use every day — and how you might be able to give something back.
